# Twitter-ZA-News-Data-Collection-and-Text-Mining
South African news Twitter accounts will have their timeline analyzed on how the topics change over time. 

# Requirements:
## Minimum requirements:
Identify a set of twitter accounts for media agencies in South Africa, extract their latest 3200
tweets, identify relevant tweets from this set, for those tweets collect relevant interaction data
(likes, retweets, and accounts retweeted etc.). With this dataset, provide a descriptive account of
1) how reporting has progressed over time, 
2) what topics have been reported on, 
3) the tonality/sentiment of this reporting (choosing the most appropriate lexicon in your view), 
4) the tonality/sentiment for specific topics, 
5) how each of these differ by a) time and b) media agency.

## Additional requirements:
In addition to the minimum requirements, to provide further insight, you are expected to identify
additional relevant sources of data that might further contribute to our understanding of the
twitter conversations in South Africa surrounding the pandemic over the last 6 months and
conduct appropriate analyses with the sources. These analyses may be similar to the primary
analyses or, optimally, they may go beyond the minimum requirements. For data, you might
consider alternative data from twitter that is relevant, or you might consider if there is anotherplatform or set of platforms that provide relevant data (for instance media reporting or other
discussion fora).

## Resources for text analysis:

- Text as Data https://cbail.github.io/textasdata/Text_as_Data.html
- sentimentr package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sentimentr/sentimentr.pdf
- vader package https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vader/vader.pdf
- udpipe package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/udpipe/udpipe.pdf
- LDA Tuning: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ldatuning/vignettes/topics.html

## Expectations:
This is simultaneously an exercise in data collection, text mining, data wrangling, visualisation,
and reporting. It is expected that your reports will include both quantitative numeric analyses as
well as text analysis. Emphasis is placed equally on the description, appropriateness, accuracy,
sophistication, and presentation of the analyses, as well as the description and presentation of
the outputs of these analyses (both visual and quantitative).
Your reports need to include all necessary background information, figures, analyses, and
statistics. Alongside the reports, you need to provide access to your analysis scripts or Rmds,
either by uploading these alongside the reports or by providing access to a repository (e.g., gitlab,
github). A PDF file of your report (with an optional zip file or link to a repository) should be
uploaded to the supplied link on Sunlearn.
