most You reckon we can dump R bn every now and again on trials for compounds which likely won t get to market because of the massive attrition rate Go read this from a guy arguing for government investing and taking it away from the companies gt The logic of this position relied on the claim that somehow government financing of the later stages of research and testing is essentially the same thing as throwing money in the toilet The industry acknowledges the value of the research funded by the National Institutes of Health NIH and in fact is the biggest lobbyist for it But they say that if NIH were to move downstream and actually finance the development of drugs and do clinical trials they would turn into a bunch of bureaucratic bozos who couldnt do anything right gt gt The behavior of the government in this pandemic seems to indicate that this is not the case The government through Operation Warp Speed is directly funding the research on vaccines as the research takes place This is most visible with Moderna the countrys leading contender to develop a vaccine The government paid million to Moderna for pre clinical research and Phase and testing It then coughed up another million to cover the cost of phase testing gt gt If any policy types thought this direct government funding of the research and development of a vaccine was just throwing money in the toilet they have not been very visible in expressing this view over the last four months It is true that Moderna will also get a patent monopoly allowing it to collect even more money for its effort but the direct funding from the government is clearly the key here This funding paid for the research and testing It also meant that the government took all the risk If Modernas vaccine turns out to be ineffective the government will be out the money not Moderna Lots of good ideas in thee article except that then the US government would typically own the patent if they funded it Are they going to sell it to other countries for cheap when their taxpayers paid for it or are we going to see the same issues with exclusivity and price gouging for foreign users like us Also what about the massive attrition rate where government here spent just shy of bn which we can t spend I don t think and if they had the AZ one it basically would have failed The Merck one failed The AZ one failed The GSK Aventis Sanofi one is delayed and likely to be pulled So that s bn wasted if costs are similar but not necessarily all by governments Also note the bit in bold there admitting that the companies take the risk

look here at the handy table of costs Add up the total on the far side and see that the companies spent just shy of bn collectively in years to get drugs to market I don t think too many governments
