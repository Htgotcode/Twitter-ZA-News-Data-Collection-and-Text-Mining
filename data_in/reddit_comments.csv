Sadly this is necessary. Drug development is incredibly expensive, and if there were no profits we would not be able to develop drugs which will not make profit.

I can assure you if it wasn't for the Viagras and the statins for cholesterol and the blood pressure meds, which do generate profit, there would be no HIV drugs and no new antibiotics, which largely do not generate profits (and rarely break even). All of those very necessary drugs are loss leaders, paid for by the lifestyle drugs and things which people are willing to pay for.

Alas research is an expensive exercise. Actual cost for 1 drug to get to market is in the order of $400m over 8-11 years, but since so many drugs fall out along the development lifetime you end up spending on average say $50bn to get only 10-12 drugs to market over a 20y period, making the effective cost closer to $4bn per drug.

Google it, and see how many come up. I don't know how else to prove it to you.

Sure the Germans chipped in for a big pandemic vaccine because they need it, but I'm fairly sure they're not funding the next drug for malaria (which they don't have) or any other tropical diseases, and things like tb which they don't have that much of is not something they can justify spending a ton of money on. Conversely, countries like Malawi do not have a few billion rand lying around to develop something for bilharzia, because they can't afford it.

Here in za we have the highest incidence of tb in the world, and also for one or the highest for hiv. How many patents or drugs for tb or hiv have we produced, when we're the ones who need it most? You reckon we can dump R3bn every now and again on trials for compounds which likely won't get to market because of the massive attrition rate?

Go read [this](https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/08/14/financing-drug-development-what-the-pandemic-has-taught-us/), from a guy arguing for government investing and taking it away from the companies:

&gt;The logic of this position relied on the claim that somehow government financing of the later stages of research and testing is essentially the same thing as throwing money in the toilet. The industry acknowledges the value of the research funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and in fact is the biggest lobbyist for it. But they say that if NIH were to move downstream and actually finance the development of drugs and do clinical trials, they would turn into a bunch of bureaucratic bozos who couldnt do anything right.\[1\]  
&gt;  
&gt;The behavior of the government in this pandemic seems to indicate that this is not the case. The government, through Operation Warp Speed, is directly funding the research on vaccines, as the research takes place. This is most visible with Moderna, the countrys leading contender to develop a vaccine. The government paid $483 million to Moderna for pre-clinical research and Phase 1 and 2 testing. It then coughed up another $472 million to cover the cost of phase 3 testing.  
&gt;  
&gt;If any policy types thought this direct government funding of the research and development of a vaccine was just throwing money in the toilet, they have not been very visible in expressing this view over the last four months. It is true that Moderna will also get a patent monopoly, allowing it to collect even more money for its effort, but the direct funding from the government is clearly the key here. This funding paid for the research and testing. **It also meant that the government took all the risk. If Modernas vaccine turns out to be ineffective, the government will be out the money, not Moderna.**

Lots of good ideas in thee article, except that then the US government would typically own the patent if they funded it. Are they going to sell it to other countries for cheap, when their taxpayers paid for it, or are we going to see the same issues with exclusivity and price-gouging for foreign users like us? Also, what about the massive attrition rate, where government here spent just shy of $1bn (which we can't spend, I don't think) and if they had the AZ one it basically would have failed? The Merck one failed. The AZ one failed. The GSK/Aventis/Sanofi one is delayed and likely to be pulled. So that's $3bn wasted if costs are similar, but not necessarily all by governments.

Also note the bit in bold there, admitting that the companies take the risk because they're the ones who spend the big bucks on the expensive stuff. What's not written there is that usually governments won't.

Edited to add: I'm in the field, working for a public-private partnership through a state-based research institute. I'm not working for big pharma, but we are more than happy to partner with them because there is no other way to get the work done.

&gt;laughs in half a billion dollars spent by the German government on only one of the vaccines

Yeah, the failed Merck one. Half a billion wasted, no? No guts no glory, sure, but also in this case alas no glory.

Also, go have a look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_drug_development#Research_and_development) at the handy table of costs. Add up the total on the far side and see that the companies spent just shy of $800bn collectively in 14 years to get drugs to market. I don't think too many governments would find that affordable, even collectively, to get those drugs made.

Numbers are trending down at an extreme rate right now, and there doesn't seem to be too much of a difference (at least in the technical details) between this 'level 1' lockdown and what we've just been through for lvl3. Sure, we can assume that people are going to start carrying on now as if we're on lvl0, but with the majority of South Africans having presumably behaved themselves (and thus contributing to the sharp decline in cases and deaths), we can expect the same compliance during level 1. 

So seriously, what kind of third wave do we expect? A minor speedbump due mostly to the 'shtupits', or a significant spike (and if so, why)? I wouldn't personally expect a major resurgence due only to a change in curfew times and a minor uptick in venue capacity (which is almost exactly what venues were adhering to during lvl3 in the first place).",Covid-19 third wave might hit earlier than expected - News24,,https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/covid-19-third-wave-might-hit-earlier-than-expected-20210302,news24.com,http://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/lvw3zg/covid19_third_wave_might_hit_earlier_than/?ref=search_posts

I think that many people do not make the connection between poor service delivery and corruption. Instead these corrupt parasites blame apartheid and the whites for the poor service delivery.

I think the more affluent and vetter educated ANC voter does not see it as  a problem because they are either already benefitting or they hope to benefit in a similar fashion in the future.

Corruption has always been a problem but since Zuma it has become so brazenly open. These arseholes hardly put in any effort to cover their tracks and every so often the media uncovers corruption and mismanagement of hundreds of millions of Rands and nothing gets done about it. Maybe some cadre redeployment or some small fry gets sent to prison for a few months but nothing with any backbone or essence.

My MIL got treated for cancer at a public hospital in KZN and it was also really good.

It seems once you're actually being attended to, things aren't quite as terrible as the collective SA expectation, which is encouraging.",My 67 year old mom survived Covid in a public hospital.,"My 67 year old mom survived a case of covid-pneumonia. She was diagnosed in January, and there were no beds in private hospitals. Eventually, she was admitted to one of the better public hospitals in JHB. 

After she had been in a general ward for a week, we got a call informing us that her condition was dire and that theyre doing all that they could for a bed to become available in ICU. If they couldnt get a bed, they would simply make my mom comfortable and tell us to come see her before the end. 

They did find a bed. I cried with the nurse on the phone when she called to inform me! They put her on a mechanical ventilator and as she improved, was given a tracheotomy whilst staying in ICU on high levels of oxygen. So far, she has been in hospital for 3 months, with the majority in ICU. This week, she was moved to a general ward and is on supplemental oxygen. The hospital is arranging for oxygen to be delivered home before they can discharge my mom. 

Even though she was at a public hospital, the doctors, nurses &amp;amp;amp;amp; physiotherapists were top class. They were so compassionate and kept us informed and answered all of our questions. They also never gave up on my Mom. Their messaging to us was always measured. 

As she was undergoing physio, the Drs were kind enough to give us permission to visit her just to encourage her because its a difficult process. Shes still doing physio but now shes walking and Im stunned when I think back to how she was just two weeks ago. 

I went to see her today and bring her lunch and snacks. Shes sitting up and so animated. She said she cant wait to come home! Its a miracle that shes alive. 

Im writing this to just highlight some of the positive things that are happening in hospitals. Its not all doom and gloom. My mom was taken care of.

The problem with the public sector as you said is resourcing, but it gets compounded by having absolutely shit management all round.

To compound it even further, people like going to hospitals for no reason. Where a you and I would go to a pharmacy and get a flu mix and go home, lots of state healthcare users rock up at hospital to get it checked out. So limited resources (staff included), are stretched even further.

That's not to say the private sector is any better mind you. Yeah it has a better face, but you would be shocked to see just how little ground work experience management in the private sector has. These are people making calls when they don't know what the fuck they are doing.

She was diagnosed in January, and there were no beds in private hospitals. Eventually, she was admitted to one of the better public hospitals in JHB. 

After she had been in a general ward for a week, we got a call informing us that her condition was dire and that theyre doing all that they could for a bed to become available in ICU. If they couldnt get a bed, they would simply make my mom comfortable and tell us to come see her before the end. 

They did find a bed. I cried with the nurse on the phone when she called to inform me! They put her on a mechanical ventilator and as she improved, was given a tracheotomy whilst staying in ICU on high levels of oxygen. So far, she has been in hospital for 3 months, with the majority in ICU. This week, she was moved to a general ward and is on supplemental oxygen. The hospital is arranging for oxygen to be delivered home before they can discharge my mom. 

Even though she was at a public hospital, the doctors, nurses &amp;amp;amp;amp; physiotherapists were top class. They were so compassionate and kept us informed and answered all of our questions. They also never gave up on my Mom. Their messaging to us was always measured. 

As she was undergoing physio, the Drs were kind enough to give us permission to visit her just to encourage her because its a difficult process. Shes still doing physio but now shes walking and Im stunned when I think back to how she was just two weeks ago. 

I went to see her today and bring her lunch and snacks. Shes sitting up and so animated. She said she cant wait to come home! Its a miracle that shes alive. 

Im writing this to just highlight some of the positive things that are happening in hospitals. Its not all doom and gloom. My mom was taken care of. The nurses were attentive and went beyond the call of duty. The Drs were patient with us, answered our questions and each one I spoke to knew my mom by name. 

Fuck COVID-19. I hate that SA doesnt have a vaccine program and that people are still behaving like theres no Covid-19. Fuck them too. But, Im grateful for the pockets of excellence in our public health facilities. 

The cake I gave to the icu staff is not enough to even thank them. My mom and our family will forever be grateful.

ETA: My mom was indeed at Charlotte Maxeke. We were promptly informed yesterday that she was to be moved and where she would be going.

So far, she has been in hospital for 3 months, with the majority in ICU. This week, she was moved to a general ward and is on supplemental oxygen. The hospital is arranging for oxygen to be delivered home before they can discharge my mom. 

Even though she was at a public hospital, the doctors, nurses &amp;amp;amp;amp; physiotherapists were top class. They were so compassionate and kept us informed and answered all of our questions. They also never gave up on my Mom. Their messaging to us was always measured. 

As she was undergoing physio, the Drs were kind enough to give us permission to visit her just to encourage her because its a difficult process. Shes still doing physio but now shes walking and Im stunned when I think back to how she was just two weeks ago. 

I went to see her today and bring her lunch and snacks. Shes sitting up and so animated. She said she cant wait to come home! Its a miracle that shes alive.

ETA: My mom was indeed at Charlotte Maxeke. We were promptly informed yesterday that she was to be moved and where she would be going.

All of her belongings are at CM and she only managed to save her glasses and slippers.

28,12,15-04-21,16-04-21,38,southafrica,0.97,227,SuperStar1124,Mulitpotentialite,3,0,"99% of people working at public hospitals are good at their jobs, the same as with private hospitals. 

The problem comes in with resource availability. Not being able to do your job properly and seeing patients die because of the lack of equipment, medicine or even maintenance of infrastructure takes a BIG mental toll on healthcare workers. 

Imagine doing your utmost best to try and help a sick person but he/she does not make it due to some beaurocratic BS redtape or lack of meds or beds. After a while you will start to feel negative towards your job and eventually just stop caring. You start to do just enough to cover your own arse and leave it at that.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our lives, and affected how we approach life and work. Since the start of the pandemic many of us were forced to change our way of work.

Colleagues are busy with an important international study aimed at understanding how COVID-19 affected your work and home life; and more importantly how you deal with it in a positive way. Specifically, we want to determine how Job Crafting and Strength Use affected the nature of your work, your work-life balance, your motivation and psychological well-being. With this information they want to develop a structured, self-help intervention that can help others cope with this 'new normal'.

They are missing the African perspective and would be really greatful if you could help by completing a short questionnaire. I promise it wont take longer than 10 mins.

* As this research is collecting data from South African it needs to be POPIA and ECT (legislation) compliant and not GDPR. Your Professor(Llewellyn E. van Zyl) is a South African so he should be acquainted with the legislation.
* How will the data be kept, for what period, and how will it be destroyed? How will the data be scrubbed of any and all identifying characteristics?  This relates to the POPIA and ECT act compliancy as GDPR doesn't cut it.
* How can I have my research removed if I decide to leave the study?
* Where the results be published?
* Do you acknowledge that this research is being conducted in English and as such your results will not cater for other language groups?
* Do you recognise that your study is drawing from reddit and thus the sample will be drawing will be skewed. Thus the data cannot be normalised and the results will effectively show little to nothing in real terms.

I'm concerned about the following: corporations/businesses might use these platforms to verify whether someone adheres to certain criteria (e.g. are you vaccinated or not), without having direct access to your personal information. They can then use this criteria to grant access to e.g. cinemas, festivals, transport, grocery stores, etc. Once these **pass**port platforms are in place, you have normalized the ability for private business to refuse service based on criteria received from these **pass**port platforms.

1,1,12-05-21,12-05-21,48,southafrica,0.99,378,LonerayngerSA,JoburgBBC,9,0,That was a hectic read. Glad you made it.,For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

Our memories are also flawed, and hence this account of events can only be validated by the degree of trust we have in our own memory.<a0>",https://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/nalfa0/for_international_nurses_day_here_is_my_story_of/,self.southafrica,http://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/nalfa0/for_international_nurses_day_here_is_my_story_of/?ref=search_posts
2,1_1,12-05-21,12-05-21,48,southafrica,0.99,378,LonerayngerSA,LonerayngerSA,7,0,Thank you,For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

Thank you for your incredibly well written account of your harrowing experience and your life-changing wisdom shared! I Love you!,For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

Geluk met jou ongeluk  :D",For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

Made me realise how petty my daily anxieties are.You're a true inspiration! Wishing you a healthy recovery.,For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

May I ask whether your pancreatic function survived? I had mild Covid in December which ended up with me in ICU for one night in February because it destroyed my pancreas (or more accurately, my pancreas destroyed itself to get rid of the Covid) Im now type 1 diabetic and on insulin for life. 

I agree with you, people generally think its a cough and bad flu, there has not been real information around how Covid attacks any organ, the lungs are just the first stop, my lungs were fine, the bastard of a bug took my pancreas. 

A friend on mine became paralysed and anothers brain were damaged and her short term memory is gone. She can never work in her field again. These other stories dont get told.",For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

Thank you for sharing.,For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

8,7,12-05-21,13-05-21,48,southafrica,0.99,378,LonerayngerSA,ThickHotBoerie,5,0,Thanks for sharing your journey dude. Glad you came out on top.,For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

If I can give any advice it would be that physio is fucking important right now. Do not slack on your rehab!,For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

Thank you for this",For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

Our memories are also flawed, and hence this account of events can only be validated by the degree of trust we have in our own memory.<a0>",https://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/nalfa0/for_international_nurses_day_here_is_my_story_of/,self.southafrica,http://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/nalfa0/for_international_nurses_day_here_is_my_story_of/?ref=search_posts

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

I wish you the best with the gift of a second chance you have been given!",For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

&amp;#x200B;

**Note**: I am not medically trained and none of the information above can or should in any way be interpreted or used as medical advice. Our memories are also flawed, and hence this account of events can only be validated by the degree of trust we have in our own memory.<a0>",https://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/nalfa0/for_international_nurses_day_here_is_my_story_of/,self.southafrica,http://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/nalfa0/for_international_nurses_day_here_is_my_story_of/?ref=search_posts
14,13,12-05-21,24-05-21,48,southafrica,0.99,378,LonerayngerSA,snugglepackTM,3,0,"My word...reading from America here. Im stunned and at a loss to describe the impact of your words on me. I will try, since I am so very grateful that you shared. 

First, I do consider myself somewhat unique in my own country/state/town in that I have a deep respect for the dangers of COVID, despite any personal experience or loss from it to date. I feel I am often stared at and talked about because I continue to wear a mask and sanitize frequently. Folks here have even reacted with silent surprise when I mention I have scheduled/completed my vaccination. Granted, I do not leave my home frequently so my personal experiences may not be accurate, but my husband works in a position that requires daily interaction with the public (including tourists) and his experiences are consistent with my own.

Next, your reframe was powerful and applicable to my and my husbands own struggle to find peace and clarity in our situation. My husband is currently surrounded by the negativity of coworkers and friends who are angry about work conditions. Similar to feelings he has only recently found a way to put to bed. Of course, concern for his friends reignited some of his own anger and resulted in a repeat of the effect his anger has had on our relationship when he carried the baggage of it home. I am being intentionally vague, my apologies for lack of details. I feel protective for my husbands sake since I cannot determine how easily identifiable I am. The point is: your story prompted me to share your reframe with my husband. And, it added more structure to the perspective he is already rebuilding to cope with his employers particular brand of workplace politics.

Finally, I, too, am grateful for the true angels of our time. I have not personally needed them, but I am grateful for them all the same. The cost we yet face collectively for our disrespect, overuse, and underpayment of their noble services I do not know. I do know they are weary and they suffer. So, yes, truly, our behavior and respect levels towards COVID need to change.

Thank you for your honesty. Thank you for your perspective. And, Thank you for sharing.

Edit: grammar",For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

16,14_1,12-05-21,12-05-21,48,southafrica,0.99,378,LonerayngerSA,LonerayngerSA,3,0,Thank you very much,For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

17,15,12-05-21,13-05-21,48,southafrica,0.99,378,LonerayngerSA,Triston-J,2,0,Wow Ray! We were praying for you. I'm amazed at your experience and grateful for your triumph. You are alive for a reason! Love you bro!,For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

Ill never forget what you went through. #wellholymolymeohmy",For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

I have been rooting for you from afar. Mom, Dad and Vince filled me in.

I will share your experience here, in America,  where sadly too many people just don't consider the severity of this virus. Hopefully,  somebody will change their mind.",For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

Good luck with your recovery, now that you love your life even more and care about it better.",For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

Our memories are also flawed, and hence this account of events can only be validated by the degree of trust we have in our own memory.<a0>",https://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/nalfa0/for_international_nurses_day_here_is_my_story_of/,self.southafrica,http://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/nalfa0/for_international_nurses_day_here_is_my_story_of/?ref=search_posts
21,19,12-05-21,14-05-21,48,southafrica,0.99,378,LonerayngerSA,brucellino,2,0,damn ray.,For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

22,20,12-05-21,16-05-21,48,southafrica,0.99,378,LonerayngerSA,WilliiamArmstrong,2,0,Wow Ray. What a well written and deeply thoughtful read. Glad you made it old pal,For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

One question, though. Do you know what became of the new patient who was begging for water? I hope hes alright. :(",For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

Our memories are also flawed, and hence this account of events can only be validated by the degree of trust we have in our own memory.<a0>",https://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/nalfa0/for_international_nurses_day_here_is_my_story_of/,self.southafrica,http://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/nalfa0/for_international_nurses_day_here_is_my_story_of/?ref=search_posts

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

27,25,12-05-21,24-05-21,48,southafrica,0.99,378,LonerayngerSA,Navashan,1,0,Thanks for sharing. Incredible read. Your daughter sounds like a gem. Glad you're still around for her,For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

Glad you made it, mate. When your time comes in a few decades, you've already earned your spot in Valhalla.",For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

What fortune to take such deep realizations from a horrible experience! Wishing you all the best in your recovery and thank you for sharing.,For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

What a story man& I am glad youre okay overall, and I hope you have a successful recovery.",For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

32,30,12-05-21,25-05-21,48,southafrica,0.99,378,LonerayngerSA,badtooth,1,0,Thank you so much for sharing your story,For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

This message is a powerful awakening to anyone who needs to hear it,For International Nurses Day - here is my story of how I survived 20 day's in hospital with severe Covid-19,"# An Antidotal Anecdote:

Many of my friends are not yet aware that I recently survived an unusually severe battle with COVID-19. It came for me hard, fast, and put me in hospital for 20 days. Most of that time was spent in ICU, from which I almost did not make it.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/v4o97ire1oy61.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7630134183b4207fc618956a49d1a44543b13d

My atypical presentation - as it was described to me - was exacerbated by secondary complications such as pneumonia, pancreatitis and a tachycardia event. These resulted in several perceived near-death experiences for me.<a0>

Family and friends who have suffered with me on this journey have asked me to write about it. While I always intended to journal for my own trauma-processing purposes, I have now decided to share this personal, painful, and powerful experience. I believe that doing so could add value, even if it helps just one person recalibrate the severity of this virus, or just one person live and learn vicariously through my experience.<a0>

One of the scariest things about Covid-19 is how it manifests and affects each person so differently. Some shrug it off like the common cold, others lose their lives, and pretty much everything in between. Its not possible to predict how it will impact you until its your turn. Some secret sauce formula we can guess includes features like the strain itself, viral load, immune system capability at the time, and the lottery of genetic predisposition.

One thing is for sure: there is enough death and severity to wake up and take this thing very seriously. It is not the flu. If we could all glimpse for just one moment the suffering experienced at the mercy of a poor reaction, the overload on the healthcare system, the exhausted heroism of the nursing teams, the tragic, unnecessary suffering and loss caused by disrespecting the virus and those in true and unavoidable need of medical attention, we, and our behaviour, would be changed forever.

Having recently recovered from more than my fair share of that glimpse, I want to share my story and associated insights, in the hopes that it may offer some valuable third-hand learning, where first-hand would be so unnecessary and full of suffering.

# April 11 - April 14

The first symptoms hit me on Sunday 11th April - a chest on fire and some very angry, yellow, and unnaturally viscous phlegm. As we do, I smashed some Bronchease and a few ACCs, and got on with the work day and single fatherhood.<a0>

By Wednesday, it was clear this was no normal flu, and I opted for a Covid test in the Ampath car-park facility on Sturdee, Rosebank, which returned positive. At that point I still believed I could carry on both with work and looking after my 4 year-old daughter alone, as she needed to isolate and quarantine with me. By all accounts that had reached me at the time, I was in for a slightly tougher flu. Arrangements were made with the baby mamma for my daughter to stay with me for 24 days as per DOH guidelines, to cover both our quarantine and isolation periods.<a0>

# April 15th<a0>

I was weakening, but still able to offer my little girl a selection of meals, and she opted, naturally, for Mac &amp; Cheese. I prepared and served it up to her as usual, and shortly thereafter I was knocked off my feet.<a0>

A 9/10 migraine took over, demanding darkness and my horizontality. Opening an eye hurt, unlocking a phone was impossible, and my peripheral perceptions of where and what my daughter was doing, started to fade. I was in trouble.<a0>

I rationed some leftover Tramacet from a recent ankle surgery to keep me present at her mealtimes. For the rest - I was drifting further and further away. Every now and then she would pop into my consciousness.<a0>

Sometimes she would have prepared a plate of food of all the items she could reach in the fridge, nursing her sick daddy in all the ways shed practiced on her dolls. Cherry tomatoes and a stale cupcake on a Princess Elsa plate were on the menu for my non-existent appetite.<a0>

At one point she decided that her time had come to learn how to open an Avocado on her own. Of course this had to take place on my bed. Despite the mess it made, having her close and knowing she was ok, was all I wanted to witness.<a0>

# April 16th<a0>

Paramedics kindly sent to my flat by Accent on You (an Accenture employee support service) came around, and I managed to successfully let them in and have blood sugar and pressure tests. Paramedics have a very specific mandate, and it was decided between us at that point that hospitalization was not yet a necessity.<a0>

There was a desire in me to avoid hospital at all costs, which in hindsight would eventually have become a fatal mistake. Thank goodness I failed in the procurement of home oxygen; in my case it would only have delayed my admission to hospital which would have worsened my chances. Ultimately I survived only because I was later hospitalised.<a0>

# April 17th

Lucy (my life-saving heroine aunty and Epidemiologist working for Right To Care, who had already survived Covid and had been vaccinated) felt my non-responsiveness telephonically was a concern.<a0> She decided it was time to enter my flat and assess the situation hands-on.<a0>

She wanted to see my ability to care for myself as well as legitimately care for my little girl - a priority equal to my own health. She came with an overnight bag and looked after us, monitoring my oxygen saturation (sats), and giving me my meds. I would wake to the sounds of her and my daughter playing all manner of elaborate games - it was the safest Id felt and would feel for some time.<a0>

# April 18th - 29th<a0>

After a night of severe rigors and a general lack of improvement of my condition, Lucy decided that it was time for hospital admission. Arrangements were made for my daughter to go to her mom and I was taken to Milpark casualty where I was checked into a ward almost immediately.

C Reactive Protein (CRP) is one of the primary inflammation markers used to determine whether one is within a Covid crisis or not. Its generally less than 10 mg/L in a healthy patient, between 10-50 mg/L in active inflammation/infection and 50 mg/L or higher in severe infections. Mine had gone from an assumed &lt;10 when healthy to 30 and then 60 mg/L over 3 three days, later spiking at 202 mg/L.<a0>

We are in such uncharted territory with Covid that the guidelines on when and how to trigger various stages of treatment are being written as we go. My own presentation has had an impact on how doctors are viewing trigger points beyond CRP markers (for example, pancreatitis is now being considered as a potential indicator).<a0>

At this point, most of my memory becomes hazy. I was heavily medicated for the headaches and inflammation, and the virus had a strong cognitive impact on me too. Ultimately things got worse. I was one bad reading away from needing intubation, after which I believe one's chances of survival go down drastically. The situation was severe and my family began to brace for the worst.<a0>

# Near death experiences

I experienced 3 Near Death Experiences (NDEs) during the course of the next few days. Two were related to the pancreatitis, and one to the very sudden and scary tachycardia event.<a0>

Pancreatitis is a disease which inflames the pancreas, and can be acute or chronic. In my case, my stomach turned its powerful enzymes in on itself for about two days, and effectively tried to digest my own organs and membranes.<a0>

The pain came out of nowhere, and recalibrated what I understood pain to be. My stomach was in full bloat, each muscle locked in a burning spasm, and then the stomach acid started to gnaw its way into my vitals. Both times this happened, I was ripped from sleep and thrown into the most extreme agony I have ever experienced.<a0>

I could not make sense of the pain I was in; I could not believe I would survive it. Two shots of morphine did not touch sides, and as I exhausted myself with cries of pain and begging to be knocked out, it came to me: stop fighting now. Salvage a small piece of mental space to run through the last lines of code, and then try to move to a more peaceful acceptance of death.

And so I did. My daughter still had her mom (check), my parents would be in her life and she would ultimately be ok (check), and my will and testament was sorted (check). OK, I can die now.<a0>

How do I die in a lessened amount of pain than this, surely not like this? Relax, breathe, accept. No more friction. No fighting, no inflammation, Ray, its OK. Youre a good man, a good dad, and you can let go now.<a0>

I dont know how long I was suspended in that state but I know I never expected to wake up.<a0>

Similarly, the tachycardia event came out of nowhere, rattling my body around my bed-cage at 140bpm in what felt like a never-ending series of immensely powerful pulsating convulsions. Not enough oxygen. Chest on fire. Confused, uncontrollable shaking. Every attempt to locate the emergency button met with instant regret - try mobilising a muscle at my own peril. So again, forced into acceptance of my own very scary, painful and confusing end.<a0>

Three times, each the same process from fight to acceptance. Same last thoughts and fears, same farewell.<a0>

But death didnt come. It was not my time to go. Maybe I was never as close as I thought I was. Maybe my big, swimming, singing lungs and some of my genetic inheritance fought to keep me alive.<a0>

This is hard to quantify. However real the threat of death actually was, however dramatic a better educated person might claim my mind was being at the time - these events were very real to me, and what I faced and endured, happened. To this end, I am happy to refer to them as legitimately perceived NDEs. I learned a lot from these and will talk more about what I took from them, later.

# April 30th

I looked down at my body and could barely recognise it. Stomach bruise-dyed purple from 4 daily Clexane (anticoagulant) shots to the gut. Hands, arms and feet looking like they belonged to a prison-camp escapee.<a0>

The added complexity of trying to draw arterial blood was a main contributor to my pin-cushion look, as nurses easily took 8-12 attempts to successfully draw it out. I learned to breathe into needling because my tension would only make it worse for the nurse, resulting in more failed attempts.<a0>

You become very grateful for the degree of adaptability baked into our blueprints. The list of things you grow accustomed to ranges from perpetual poking, prodding, pricking, lack of sleep, ability to sleep with all manner of cables and connectors plugged onto you, high flow oxygen blowing into your nose, bathing and going to the toilet adjacent to your bed in a room full of people, the mercy cries of your fellow inmates, and so on.<a0>

You cannot fathom adjusting to it until you are in the situation itself and I think the average person will always be appreciatively surprised at just how effectively we were built to adapt, as we, understandably, seldom go to such trying places.<a0>

Luckily, in the subsequent days, all secondary complications started to fade and I was able to focus on the primary task of healing my lungs and improving my ability to retain oxygen.<a0>

# May 1st<a0>

I was still in the ICU. I had blown through every single piece of arterial real-estate across all my hands, arms and feet to insert an IV line. Several nurses would be called in to try. They would wipe with alcohol, feel for a vein and then tourniquet. Next they irritate the vein with a few flicks, insert the needle and try to withdraw some blood - time and again, no dice.<a0>

This went on for a good 15 minutes, sequentially sticking the needle into whatever looked blue and felt proud of the skin. Nothing. This is a problem typically solved by a Central Venous Pipe (CVP), a 20cm floating line that gets inserted into your neck to get the meds in. Arguably this could, or should, have been done on day one as its a highly effective and stable line in - but my nurses opted for IV, and Im told the CVP is no fun to erect.<a0>

Surely not now, not so close to the end. I prayed. Luckily for me, as they were preparing me for the CVP, a kind doctor came to see if he could crack the challenge and got an IV successfully up in my left elbow. I was saved from the CVP, but it meant I lost the use of my left hand. A high price, but a valuable trade nonetheless. Mentally I needed my experience to ease - silly as it was, I couldn't face the CVP.

# May 2nd<a0>

Movement. I was told that I was to be transferred out of ICU. I naively hoped this was due to strong enough sats, and that it was already my time to transfer to a ward, but this was not the case.

I was downgraded to a different, older ICU to make way for a patient in more dire need of the higher tech bed and room I had been enjoying. Somehow excited at the prospect of a change in scenery albeit unknown, and comforted by the fact that I was the strong enough candidate to make way, I took a celebratory selfie of me sitting in a chair while they cleaned the old room and prepared my new bedroom.<a0>

But after about 30 mins sitting in the halls of ICU 1, the arguments about me being in the way had risen to a point where it trumped the fact that my new bed wasnt ready and I was wheeled unceremoniously down to the older ICU. The juxtaposition was stark and frightening.<a0>

The first thing that hit me was the sheer volume of noise as staff did their best to manage chaos. Next, the high density nature of the patient and staff population hit. It was comparatively dirty, equipment stashed in every spare corner. Patients groaning, wheezing and wailing to a compassion-fatigued fleet of nursing ears.<a0>

There was no bed for me. Disappointment hit the faces of those who realized they needed to take in yet another last minute patient.

<a0>At least its not his fault, I heard. We are working like headless chickens.<a0>

I was asked to sit in an old dirty chair while they made up a bed. Crashing into my new reality, I hadn't realized how good Id had it in the 5 star experience of Milparks Covid CCU.<a0>

# May 3rd<a0>

As could be expected, it was a harrowing night for me in this downgraded ICU, with its pressing proximity and lack of privacy. It constantly hummed with light, activity, and high volume dialogue. The place never slept, and so neither did I.<a0>

To my right was an elderly woman suffering Covid dementia, a diagnosis that went a long way to explaining what Id been hearing beneath her perpetual outcries of pain. She was deluded and delirious.<a0>

Her regular screams were altered by some liquid oscillation in her throat, like a seagull's final squawks as it gargles in its own blood, sometimes for no reason with no one near her, and other times when nurses tended to her. She didn't know where she was, and I shivered to think what the experience must have been like for her. By the time they came to take my blood and X-rays at 4am, she was asleep, so I managed to get a little much needed rest between then and 6am breakfast.<a0>

# May 4th<a0>

Was this the day I would be released to a Ward? My sats were at 96% with only 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Surely I was ready?<a0><a0>

From 6am to 6pm I patiently and hopefully waited for the lead Doctors word that I could move out of this place. 6pm came and he walked in. I raised my bed-back and sat upright, wanting to present myself to him in as strong a manner as possible.

Im happy with your progress, he said, but I need you to suffer one more night here for me.<a0>

My heart sank as I grappled with the amplitude of hope Id built up. Id mismanaged my own expectations and the cost was high. I had a mouth full of ulcers too painful to allow for brushing of teeth. I was covered in rashes from the virus, medication, and the fact that I hadnt been able to wash soap off my body in almost 20 days. Enduring the wailing and lack of sleep. I asked myself how I would survive as my delicate balance of mental fortitude came crashing down for a spell.<a0>

As one can expect, the night was rough.

I met my new nurse, who could barely speak English, and my heart sank further as he struggled to ask me what medication he should give me. It is always a deflating moment as you realise that the systems in place to track and verify your health indicators are not effective, and the reliance on you, the patient, to keep track, weighs heavily.<a0>

During the course of the night the nurse had made so many errors, I was at DEFCON1 trying to manage my own treatment. He did not know what meds should have been given to me, or when, and brought the large ICU charts to me in my bed, asking me to help him decipher them.<a0>

He needed reminding to get the air pockets out of the syringe before he went directly into the IV line. He didnt know how the stop-cock worked, and struggled to get meds into me. He also allowed a bunch of my blood to back-leak needlessly onto me and my bed by not closing the system.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/dwq0im3i1oy61.jpg?width=804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29fafb5bf2feaf8764725291ef780e01124a681

He went on a break without reconnecting my oxygen post nebuliser, so when all the alarms were going off at my dropped sats, I ran my hands along the oxygen mask, found the connector on the floor, and plugged it in myself! Upon his return he simply said, Im not coping.

3am came and the place was still humming, all lights on, much back and forth dialogue amongst all staff on the floor. The nurse came to take blood. Again, pricking and poking, trying to tease some blood into a syringe but somehow the veins run dry. No more blood for the tests.<a0>

To my left, and now contributing stereo to the harrowing audio of the Covid dementia patient to my right, was a new patient in the ICU, whose situation was dire. He had a huge mask on that had more pipes than Id ever seen before. He couldnt breathe easily and was due to be intubated. His arm had tissued so badly from a government hospital that recently transferred him, he was begging for mercy and death by turns, in muffled cries from beneath his breathing system.<a0>

I could relate to his cries for mercy and kept asking the nurses how we could help him.<a0>

Hes crying for water, I said, can you give him mine?.<a0>

Sadly, he had to suffer and wait for intubation, and so ICU life and logistics carried on around him. It was almost worse witnessing his misery than it was enduring mine. I put my headphones in, music on max, and tried to escape.

I am certain that even my downgraded 3 star ICU is still a relatively luxurious place to recover, compared to what most of our population will have to endure. Even the somewhat comfortable realities of this thing are harrowing, and the public health system appears on the back foot for the grim realities of what may be required to heal our nation from another wave post winter. So even in my downgraded ICU, I had it good.<a0>

# May 5th - 6th

The long-awaited day had come! I was finally sent from ICU back to the ward. The first thing I did was run a bath and soaked in it for 30 minutes with my mobile oxygen. The problem with the wipe-down baths you take in your IC room, is that you cant rinse the soap and alcohol off your skin. I was dry, burnt, rashed, and caked in many layers of chemicals from the past 2 weeks. The feeling of open skin was indescribably euphoric, and I quickly entered a healing stride as all the returning little luxuries lifted my spirits.<a0>

# 7th May

On Friday 7th May, I was finally discharged from Milpark Hospital and sent home with oxygen and a fat script. I was told I was unfit to care for myself yet, and that I need to be isolated for 7 days.<a0> Fortunately, there was a vacant cottage on my parents property where I could stay for the next part of the journey. What an unusually fortunate setup where I have access to contactless care on site from my family, and I am also able to properly isolate myself from them.<a0>

Should either of them get Covid, its likely they could suffer an equally bad if not worse reaction than mine, given the genetic predisposition component of my adverse reaction - so the stakes are high.<a0>

In terms of healing, I am looking at 4-6 months for a full lung recovery, the duration of the immunity I have just earned. Being too sedentary and not taking anticoagulants can cause fatal clots, while exercising too rigorously (relative) can land me straight back in hospital.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/8amgv92k1oy61.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743017a91f18337d472df6881c272bf0473369bf

The path is long, and does not end when you leave hospital. Even as I sit and write from the comfort of a sunny balcony with Mums heavenly bacon &amp; cabbage soup, I endure multi-faceted symptoms from whiting out when I stand up, to weakness and frequent shortness of breath. There is the ongoing need for oxygen accompanied by a bleeding nose, and withdrawal symptoms from weaning off the various strong meds. My body is covered in a rash, my gums bleed, and I have a mouth full of ulcers. They all serve as reminders of the depths to which this ordeal took me.

I needed to capture this detail in near real-time, as I can feel selective memory kicking in, and my brain starts to blur and diminish the experience, blissfully beyond the walls of that ICU.<a0>

Before all this fades away, while the insight is clear and the motivation strong, I lean on writing to help me fossilize what I have learned.

There is something very powerful about a legitimately perceived NDE. There may not have been the situational luxury for such profound insight at the very moment it occurs. However, there has certainly been a wellspring of retrospective insight and introspection as a function of those events, and some of this I believe is valuable to document, and share.<a0>

# Powerful Gratitude

It was only three days after I joined the space-age medical trial (Remdesivir and Tocilizumab), that I began to get my cognitive ability back. That was when I took the time to take stock of the amount of things to be grateful for inside of this situation, and I realized just how incredibly lucky I was with my Covid experience. 

Lucky to have had an aunt that got me to hospital on day 8 (the earliest one can). Lucky that the hospital was in a relative lull as opposed to a wave and that I enjoyed quick attention. Lucky that I got onto oxygen so fast, that I was so close to ICU, and that I got there in an expedited fashion, at the moment I needed to. Lucky that I have a good medical aid, lucky that new medications not only exist (which they didnt 6 months ago) but that I had access to them. Lucky that none of my family got infected by me. The list goes on, and sadly this list will not be the case for the majority of our population.<a0>

# Gl<fc>ck im Ungl<fc>ck<a0>

*(something that has proved to be fortunate after initially seeming unfortunate)*

One of the first things that occurred to me retrospectively is the degree to which there may be unrealized potential at the end of a life, due to highly unnecessary reasons. In the final tally, when there seemed to be no future in which to manifest change, I felt a sense of deflation or disappointment that I had spent so much time holding onto anger.<a0>

Not forgiving, not letting go. What did I really get in exchange for a white clenched fist and my unrelenting lack of forgiveness on topics and with people that I felt I had to make a stand and stay rigidly resentful? I inflicted so much hurt against myself, burnt up my immune system and wasted so much discretional energy supply, all of which contributed to the depths of my dire situation by encountering the virus in such a depleted state.

If I can use these insights to transform and manufacture positive changes to my core, changes that will improve my own quality of life and health for the next few decades, then this life event would be one of my biggest fruit-bearing gifts for the rest of my bonus days. How can I not focus and pursue that end? I have to, and I will.<a0>

# The Power of the Reframe

I decided to go on a radical reframing exercise no matter how counter-intuitive that seemed. I foregrounded my recently drafted gratitude list and realized that I was, by some metrics, on holiday.<a0>

I simultaneously had neither work nor parental duties - a rare combination that tends to happen only during health issues. My responsibilities were on hold. Granted, Id chosen an odd location for vacation, but then even on my gap years Id sought out immersion in all manner of weird and wonderful cultures.<a0>

This time it was the bright white land of the highly caring flock of overgrown yellow penguins (referencing the appearance of the Milpark PPE gear). Since I wasnt allowed visitors, it was retreat-esque in terms of solitude, silence and time to introspect. The penguins had their own code, systems, and behavioral patterns which I observed with intrigue as I allowed quiet narration from dear David Attenborough in my mind. It was fascinating, fresh and relatively peaceful between crises.

Every sliver of positivity one creates in a positive reframe, immediately yields more resources to dedicate to the same cause. I was surprised by just how fast the script flipped, how quickly I got behind and partook in my own journey to healing from there on out. One of my wishes in capturing and sharing this is that someone somewhere, in a future and similarly dire situation may recall this concept and help themselves reduce their own suffering while creating the best possible chemical environment for recovery.<a0>

# What is the quality of your life?

In the context of death, I consider everything from this point forward as a gift; as bonus time. It is impossible not to be reinvented by this realisation. Once I had assessed my prior life's inadvertent choices and beliefs that cascaded across my psychology, physiology, emotions, and ultimately my health, I knew I needed to change. I now understood viscerally what I previously grasped only conceptually.

A friend who shared my exposure and positive Covid result shrugged off the virus, not even needing to stop working from home. That means two things with respect to my reaction: genetic predisposition, and the state of my immune system at the time (viral load and strain were shared).<a0>

I know that how run down I had let myself become, was a huge contributing factor to my severe situation. It nearly cost me my life. This experience was actually a wake-up call from life.<a0>

In what I believed were my final moments, I felt with such crystal clarity the deflation at the unnecessary suffering and unrealized potential of how I was living before. Not just in terms of lacking forgiveness, but also the extent to which I had let work and life stress get completely out of control. I had allowed them to bleed well beyond their natural boundaries, encroaching ever more into time that should have been strictly reserved for family, presence, calm, self-love, and the celebration of lifes special moments.

Life is precious, tomorrow is not guaranteed. There is a sweet spot between living a sanitised denialistic existence, and facing the inevitably of our own death that I believe sits a lot closer to accepting our own mortality than many of us do. Find that sweet-spot for yourself because that's where your freedom and power sit.<a0>

The path toward change is not entirely clear yet, but I can feel a chapter closing, new questions arising, realisations that cannot be unseen, and an unshakable drive to adjust accordingly, to go back to life smarter, calmer, and free.

# The true angels of our time

Frontline workers are Heroes and Valkyries. Many of them have had Covid and lost colleagues to it, yet they voluntarily walk into Covid red wards and ICUs daily to help the sick - its hard to believe such people even exist.<a0>

https://preview.redd.it/lnnnk1xl1oy61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ffe946a80c8113481eb829fbfb788e6d35e7b

Its easy to see why they are so angry at South Africans who view this pandemic as just a flu, who dont act with respect for the virus and its impact on an already overloaded system. There is a cost, sometimes in life to others in need, every time a healthy person who could easily avoid becoming infected, needlessly gets infected.<a0>

Our behaviour and respect levels towards Covid need to change

I don't know why people think that would completely protect them, I get frustrated whenever I see that. It reduces the risk, sure, but people can and do still get infected.

You will note that the person serving you wears a mask, so you can't get infected from them. They take a huge risk serving people who are to dam selfish they can't go without sitting down in a restaurant,  so instead decide to put themselves and the restaurant people at risk just to eat some random food in a different place.

I haven't eaten out since March 2020 - I get takeaways and eat in my house where I am not going to infect other people.

Plan was(is?) several days in Cape Town, a few more in the winelands and then flying CPT to Skukuza for our lodge. As long as flights to JNB resume before the safari (and things aren't too dire), we'll try to make it work by buying tickets JNB-CPT and carrying on with our itinerary as planned.

If things get pushed back too far, we'll have to reschedule anyway and might as well wait until we can have the full experience, especially considering the wine tastings are one of the main draws for us. :)

At that age you're more likely to die in a car accident.

There is no evidence to suggest that our previous lockdowns have succeeded in slowing or stopping the spread. If you look at the graph of infections, it's impossible to point out where restrictions were tightened or loosened. Loosening restrictions has also not correlated with outbreaks. The disease moves independently of our blunt measures against it.

And moreover, this shit has never been done before in the history of the world. It's completely against all pre-2020 pandemic guidelines.

Traffic is a little less congestive because Schools being closed but Businesses are still open. Our company has had 3 positive cases since last week Thursday with 14 additional Employees that are on sick leave but have not been tested. This is out of 62 people in our company. My Uncle has been on a ventilator and induced coma for two weeks and intensive care. They had to go through his tragea as the ventilator mask didn't ensure enough oxygen. They started him on dialysis on Sunday for his kidneys. Another Uncle of mine fell yesterday and we had to go to three Hospitals before one could assist us with a brain scan. Luckily the Neurologist said that his brain is fine but would have preferred to keep him there for his other injuries but they simply don't have any beds open so he is being treated at home. With all this I had to confront an old Lady at Spar an hour ago as she took her mask off to smell the cheese in the dairy isle. Firstly it's vacuum sealed so how can you smell it and secondly now is not the time for people to be negligent about following health protocol.

https://www.sahpra.org.za/press-releases/sahpra-authorises-the-coronavac-vaccine-with-conditions/

and here is the relevant section on the conditions:

""This authorisation is based on the safety, quality and efficacy data submitted by Curanto Pharma (Pty) Ltd to SAHPRA between 22 March 2021 and 22 June 2021. Although the data submitted are considered acceptable at this point, the authorisation is subject to a number of conditions. Specifically, the applicant is required to submit the final results of ongoing clinical studies. SAHPRA also took account of the World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Use Listing (EUL) report on this vaccine.

In addition, the conditions require the submission of periodic safety updates in accordance with SAHPRA guidance, and conformance with pharmacovigilance activities as outlined in the approved risk management plan. As outlined in the clinical trial evidence submitted by the applicant, most of the side effects following administration of the CoronaVac vaccine were mild or moderate in nature, and cleared within a couple of days. The frequently-reported adverse reactions were: pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea and nausea.
