I don't know why people think that would completely protect them, I get frustrated whenever I see that. It reduces the risk, sure, but people can and do still get infected.

You will note that the person serving you wears a mask, so you can't get infected from them. They take a huge risk serving people who are to dam selfish they can't go without sitting down in a restaurant,  so instead decide to put themselves and the restaurant people at risk just to eat some random food in a different place.

Plan was(is?) several days in Cape Town, a few more in the winelands and then flying CPT to Skukuza for our lodge. As long as flights to JNB resume before the safari (and things aren't too dire), we'll try to make it work by buying tickets JNB-CPT and carrying on with our itinerary as planned.

If things get pushed back too far, we'll have to reschedule anyway and might as well wait until we can have the full experience, especially considering the wine tastings are one of the main draws for us. :)

Is my trip from Jo'burg to Kruger and back for commercial purposes? Can I enter Jo'burg and claim it's for commercial purposes (transaction with a tour provider)? Am I still transiting through Gauteng if I stay the night at an airport hotel?

At that age you're more likely to die in a car accident. And long Covid as a mass phenomenon is dubious at best, having its origins in an online survey of hypochondriacs who probably never had Covid in the first place. Ever since the global media decided that worrying about the virus wasn't racist against Chinese people, we've been inundated with scare-mongering anecdotes about minority cases, presented in a deceptive way so as to make people scared of highly improbable things.

There is no evidence to suggest that our previous lockdowns have succeeded in slowing or stopping the spread. If you look at the graph of infections, it's impossible to point out where restrictions were tightened or loosened. Loosening restrictions has also not correlated with outbreaks. The disease moves independently of our blunt measures against it.

And moreover, this shit has never been done before in the history of the world. It's completely against all pre-2020 pandemic guidelines.

Our company has had 3 positive cases since last week Thursday with 14 additional Employees that are on sick leave but have not been tested. This is out of 62 people in our company. My Uncle has been on a ventilator and induced coma for two weeks and intensive care. They had to go through his tragea as the ventilator mask didn't ensure enough oxygen. They started him on dialysis on Sunday for his kidneys. Another Uncle of mine fell yesterday and we had to go to three Hospitals before one could assist us with a brain scan. Luckily the Neurologist said that his brain is fine but would have preferred to keep him there for his other injuries but they simply don't have any beds open so he is being treated at home. With all this I had to confront an old Lady at Spar an hour ago as she took her mask off to smell the cheese in the dairy isle. Firstly it's vacuum sealed so how can you smell it and secondly now is not the time for people to be negligent about following health protocol.

But we manufacture products used in the Mining industry so we have been open since lockdown started and have been fortunate not to have had any Covid incidents before now. We have had one employee turn up to work who tested positive but it has been deemed as a low risk exposure so we only have to monitor all employees for ten days for symptoms. Our Directors will do everything in their power to keep us open but most of our Managers feel we should close for a while and just try and get back to a functioning system.

https://www.sahpra.org.za/press-releases/sahpra-authorises-the-coronavac-vaccine-with-conditions/

and here is the relevant section on the conditions:

""This authorisation is based on the safety, quality and efficacy data submitted by Curanto Pharma (Pty) Ltd to SAHPRA between 22 March 2021 and 22 June 2021. Although the data submitted are considered acceptable at this point, the authorisation is subject to a number of conditions. Specifically, the applicant is required to submit the final results of ongoing clinical studies. SAHPRA also took account of the World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Use Listing (EUL) report on this vaccine.

In addition, the conditions require the submission of periodic safety updates in accordance with SAHPRA guidance, and conformance with pharmacovigilance activities as outlined in the approved risk management plan. As outlined in the clinical trial evidence submitted by the applicant, most of the side effects following administration of the CoronaVac vaccine were mild or moderate in nature, and cleared within a couple of days. The frequently-reported adverse reactions were: pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea and nausea.

Curanto Pharma (Pty) Ltd must provide any data or information generated or which otherwise comes into their possession, which is relevant to the risk / benefit profile of the product and/or is relevant to the conditions of use. The company is also obliged to share any such information received from the manufacturers. In particular, any data on the efficacy/effectiveness of the vaccine against disease caused by emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern shall be provided to the regulator.""",Sahpra approves use of Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine,,https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/sahpra-approves-use-of-sinovac-covid-19-vaccine-d068895c-d7b5-424d-b75e-cf11ab5a26d1,iol.co.za,http://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/octwlj/sahpra_approves_use_of_sinovac_covid19_vaccine/?ref=search_posts
